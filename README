Code Files: sh.c

Overall Structure of Program (More Detailed comments are in my ‘sh.c’ file): 

Helper functions:

—ignoring_signals(): sets signals to ignore
-default_signals(): sets signal to default behaviour
-bg(char *cmd_array[]): Takes care of scenario where user input is “bg”
-fg(char * cmd_array[]): Takes care of scenario where user input is “fg”
-reaping_foreground(char * cmd_array[],pid_t *fork_pid): Reaps foreground process when use r input calls foreground process
-reaping_background(): Reaps all processes in job list 

Detailed Comments relating to what these do in detail are best found in my sh.c file

Where I dealt with what in main:

Anytime a user inputted a command that I had to implement, I dealt with it in the main function after parsing but before forking

After forking and execution, I dealt with printing jobs if process is executed with “&”,reaping foreground processes and reaping background processes.

Whenever I exited the program I would clean up the job list. Furthermore, I set the appropriate process groups to the window, to the child process in forking and to the parent after forking. 

NOTE about my function design: If an error was found in any of my functions, since it would take place in the while loop for the REPL, I would want to call continue in the loop. Therefore, many of my functions return an int 0 on success and 1 on error. I error check these functions so when there is an error, my program continues to the next iteration of the while loop. 



How to compile: run ‘make all’ in your terminal for both versions of my shell or ‘make 33sh’ or ‘make 33noprompt’
